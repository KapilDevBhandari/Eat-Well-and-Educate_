                <h3>Potato Salad</h3>
                <img src="/college assignment/image/potato salad 0.png" alt="Potato salad" id ="potato">
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound fingerling potatoes
                     <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup green peas</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup finely chopped red onion</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons mustard oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon fenugreek(Methi) seeds</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                    <li>1 cup plain yogurt whisked until smooth</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Scrub the potatoes under cold running water and cut them into 1-inch pieces.
                        Place them in a small or medium-size saucepan and cover them with cold
                        water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low,
                        partially cover the pan, and gently boil until the potatoes are tender when
                        pierced with a fork or knife but still firm, 10 to 12 minutes. Fish the pieces out
                        of the water with a slotted spoon and place them in a medium-size bowl.</li>
                    <li>Drop the peas into the potato cooking water and boil them just to warm them
                        up, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain them in a colander, give them a good shake or two
                        to remove any excess water, and add the peas to the potatoes along with the
                        onion.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil appears to
                        shimmer and smells quite pungent, sprinkle in the coriander, cumin, and
                        fenugreek seeds. Allow them to sizzle and turn reddish brown, about 1
                        minute. Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle in the cayenne and
                        turmeric, staining the oil with their sunny dispositions. Pour most of the oil out
                        over the potatoes and peas, holding back the seeds in the skillet as much as
                        you can. Scrape these seeds into a mortar and pulverise them into a coarse
                        powder with a pestle. Or if you donâ€™t have one, transfer them to a spice
                        grinder (like a coffee grinder) and grind them. Scrape this blend into the bowl
                        with the potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Add the yogurt, cilantro, and salt to the potatoes and give it all a good stir.
                        Serve at room temperature.</li>
                </ol>
