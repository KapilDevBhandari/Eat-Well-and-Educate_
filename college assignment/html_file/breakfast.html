                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk, 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the dry ingredients (flour mixture) and mix until just combined.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients (buttermilk mixture) to the dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth batter forms.</li>
                    <li>Stir in any additional ingredients you desire, such as blueberries, chocolate chips, or chopped nuts. Fold them gently into the batter until evenly distributed.</li>

                <h3>Omelette and Potatoes</h3>
                <img src="/college assignment/image/Omelette and Potatoes.png" alt="Omelette and Potatoes" id="omelette">
                <p>Ingredients for 2 Omelettes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>4 large eggs</li>
                    <li>Splash of milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 red chilli, finely chopped (remove seeds if you like things milder)</li>
                    <li>50g cheese, grated</li>
                    <li>2 tsp chives, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>5 button mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 tomatoes, seeds removed and finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 knobs of butter (1 for each omelette)</li>
                    <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk with a fork until the egg yolk is
                        completely mixed into the egg whites. Add a splash of milk and give the
                        mixture another stir.</li>
                    <li>Add all the other ingredients to the mixture (except the cheese & the butter)
                        and give it a good mix.</li>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, then add the egg mixture.
                        Use a small spatula to run around the edges of the pan, tipping the frying pan
                        so the uncooked egg from the center of the pan can run under the bottom of
                        the cooked egg. Continue to use this method until the egg in the center is
                        nearly cooked (it should still be just a little moist), and now add the cheese to
                        the pan.</li>
                    <li>Once the cheese has just started to melt, the omelette should be ready. Fold
                        the omelette over and serve with the potatoes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>Ingredients for the Potatoes</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>2 large potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
                    <li>1 cm thumb of root ginger, peeled and grated</li>
                    <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
                    <li>5 dried curry leaves</li>
                    <li>1 red chilli, finely chopped (add more if you like things hot)</li>
                    <li>3/4 tsp turmeric</li>
                    <li>Salt & Pepper (to taste)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instructions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the Potatoes for around 12 minutes or until they are tender but not
                        breaking up. Remove from the pan and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan and add the cumin & mustard seeds and fry for 1
                        minute. After around one minute the seeds should start popping - at this point
                        add in the garlic, onion, curry leaves and chilli to the pan and stir fry for a
                        further 2 minutes, or until the onions have started to soften.</li>
                    <li>Add the turmeric and potatoes to the frying pan and mix well so that
                        everything is coated in the lovely yellow colour of the turmeric. You will
                        probably need to cook the potatoes on a medium heat for around 4 - 5
                        minutes depending on how small you cubed your potatoes. Make sure the
                        heat is not on too high as the potatoes will burn - although you can always
                        add a bit of water if the potatoes are sticking to the pan.</li>
                </ol>
